I'm a Computer Science and Engineering undergraduate student at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Gandhinagar, India. 

My research interests lie the interestion of bioinformatics and machine learning. I have been particulary interested in the applications of machine learning in various domains, but I have started leaning towards solving important healthcare problems. I believe that machine learning will play an major role in transforming healthcare in the years to come.
